# Automated Video Therapy System for Reducing Unwanted Body-Focused Behavior

## 1. Data Collection
- Use **webcams** to capture videos of individuals displaying the unwanted behavior (forming the "positive" class).
- Capture videos without the behavior for the "negative" class.
- Accurately label these videos or frames.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
- Convert videos into frames for ease of processing.
- Employ techniques like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation (like rotations, flips) to enhance the dataset.

## 3. Model Building using TensorFlow/Keras
- Utilize **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, as they excel with image/video data.
- The architecture might comprise multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, culminating in a binary classification (behavior present or not).

## 4. Training
- Split data into training and validation sets.
- Train the CNN on the training set and validate its performance on the validation set.
- Integrate techniques like dropout for regularization and callbacks like early stopping to curb overfitting.
- Preserve the model exhibiting the best performance on the validation data.

## 5. Real-time Detection
- Convert the video into frames in real-time using a webcam feed.
- Feed each frame through the trained model to pinpoint the unwanted behavior.
- On detecting the behavior, furnish immediate feedback, possibly an alert or sound.

## 6. Positive Reinforcement
- If the user abstains from the unwanted behavior for a designated duration, provide positive feedback. This could be encouraging messages or tangible rewards.

## 7. User Interface
- Design a **user-friendly interface** offering real-time feedback, tracking progress over time, and supplying resources for added assistance.
- Prioritize addressing privacy concerns since this deals with sensitive personal data.

## 8. Model Updating
- Periodically refresh the model with new data to enhance accuracy.
- Solicit user feedback on false positives/negatives to refine the model further.

## 9. Deployment
- Ensure seamless operation of the application with real-time webcam feeds.
- Fine-tune the model for latency to offer instant feedback.

> **Note**: This is a broad conceptual framework. Actual implementation would require prioritizing privacy, having a robust dataset, rigorous training, and extensive testing. Ethical considerations, especially in the context of mental health or behavioral disorders, are of paramount importance.
